The Martian Aerospace Agency is part of the first human colony on Mars, and wants a monetary system for the colony. This new monetary system will be based on blockchain technology, with a new cryptocurrency called KaseiCoin. (“Kasei” means “Mars” in Japanese.)

KaseiCoin will be a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant. You will launch a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.

The steps for this Challenge are divided into the following sections:

    1. Create the KaseiCoin Token Contract
    2. Create the KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract
    3. Create the KaseiCoin Deployer Contract
    4. Deploy the Crowdsale to a Local Blockchain
    5. Optional: Extend the Crowdsale Contract by Using OpenZeppelin

Steps 1-3 are complete. The KaseiCoin token was created using Solidify in Remix - IDE, the software to run is:
  KaseiCoinCrowdsale.sol
  KaseiCoin.sol

Both were compiled, screenshot below:

Step 4 requires deployment of the crowdsale to a local blockchain using Remix, MetaMask, and Ganache. First test accounts were set up using Ganache, then functionality of of the crowdsale was tested by using MetaMask after settinng up Ganach test accounts.
