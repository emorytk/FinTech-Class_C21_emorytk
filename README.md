The Martian Aerospace Agency is part of the first human colony on Mars, and wants a monetary system for the colony. This new monetary system will be based on blockchain technology, with a new cryptocurrency called KaseiCoin. (“Kasei” means “Mars” in Japanese.)

KaseiCoin will be a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant. You will launch a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.

The KaseiCoin Token Contract, the KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract, and the KaseiCoin Deployer Contract are here:
  
    KaseiCoinCrowdsale.sol
  
    KaseiCoin.sol

KaseiCoinCrowdsale.sol and KaseiCoin.sol were compiled, screenshot below:

Deployment of the crowdsale to a local blockchain using Remix, MetaMask, and Ganache was completed screen shots showing the wallets.

Optional: Extend the Crowdsale Contract by Using OpenZeppelin to extend the crowdsale contract to enhance its functionality

To keep the coding separate, the KaseiCoin Token Contract, the KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract, and the KaseiCoin Deployer Contract were added in separate Solidity files than the original:
  
    v2KaseiCoinCrowdsale.sol
  
    v2KaseiCoin.sol

Both v2 files were compiled, screenshot below:

I don't know EXACTLY what I did to get this to deploy, but I got it to deploy using a different MetaMask wallet than previously used, see screen shots below:
