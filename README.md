The Martian Aerospace Agency is part of the first human colony on Mars, and wants a monetary system for the colony. This new monetary system will be based on blockchain technology, with a new cryptocurrency called KaseiCoin. (“Kasei” means “Mars” in Japanese.)

KaseiCoin will be a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant. You will launch a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.

The steps for this Challenge are divided into the following sections:

    1. Create the KaseiCoin Token Contract
    2. Create the KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract
    3. Create the KaseiCoin Deployer Contract
    4. Deploy the Crowdsale to a Local Blockchain
    5. Optional: Extend the Crowdsale Contract by Using OpenZeppelin

Steps 1-3 are complete. The KaseiCoin token was created using Solidify in Remix - IDE, the software to run is:
  KaseiCoinCrowdsale.sol
  KaseiCoin.sol
  
Both were compiled, screenshot below


Step 4 requires deployment of the crowdsale to a local blockchain using Remix, MetaMask, and Ganache. 1
