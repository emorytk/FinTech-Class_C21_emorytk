The Martian Aerospace Agency is part of the first human colony on Mars, and wants a monetary system for the colony. This new monetary system will be based on blockchain technology, with a new cryptocurrency called KaseiCoin. (“Kasei” means “Mars” in Japanese.)

KaseiCoin will be a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant. You will launch a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.

The KaseiCoin Token Contract, the KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract, and the KaseiCoin Deployer Contract are here:
  
    KaseiCoinCrowdsale.sol
  
    KaseiCoin.sol

KaseiCoinCrowdsale.sol and KaseiCoin.sol were compiled, screenshot below:

Deployment of the crowdsale to a local blockchain using Remix, MetaMask, and Ganache was completed screen shots showing the wallets.

Optional: Extend the Crowdsale Contract by Using OpenZeppelin to extend the crowdsale contract to enhance its functionality

The new contracts were compiled, see the below screen shots:

I don't know EXACTLY what I did to get this to deploy, I did the "OR At Address" using the Ganache key and got a deployed contract:

I was then able to buy 5 ETH from the MetaMask address (account 4) that was a different account than those used previously. You can see the Balance shows 5ETH und

I was unable to get the code with the optional items to work, they are in the file as v2KaseiCoinCrowdsale.sol and v2KaseiCoin.sol and when I ran them, they were KaseiCoinCrowdsale.sol and KaseiCoin.sol.
