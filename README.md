The Martian Aerospace Agency is part of the first human colony on Mars, and wants a monetary system for the colony. This new monetary system will be based on blockchain technology, with a new cryptocurrency called KaseiCoin. (“Kasei” means “Mars” in Japanese.)

KaseiCoin will be a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant. You will launch a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.

The KaseiCoin Token Contract, the KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract, and the KaseiCoin Deployer Contract are here:
